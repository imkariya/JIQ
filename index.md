# Question 1
##### Given a square matrix, the task is that we turn it by 180 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space. 
Examples : 

```js
Input :  1 2 3 4 
         5 6 7 8 
         9 0 1 2 
         3 4 5 6 
```
```js
Output : 6 5 4 3 
         2 1 0 9 
         8 7 6 5 
         4 3 2 1
```




# Question 2

#####  Given an unsorted array of integers, sort the array into a wave like array. An array â€˜arr[0..n-1]â€™ is sorted in wave form if arr[0] >= arr[1] <= arr[2] >= arr[3] <= arr[4]

Example
```js
Input:  arr[] = {10, 5, 6, 3, 2, 20, 100, 80}
```
```js
 Output: arr[] = {10, 5, 6, 2, 20, 3, 100, 80} OR
                 {20, 5, 10, 2, 80, 6, 100, 3} OR
                 any other array that is in wave form
```

# Question 3

##### Minimum number of deletion in a string to make it a palindrome
```js
Input : aebcbda
Output : 2
Remove characters 'e' and 'd'
Resultant string will be 'abcba'
which is a palindromic string
```
